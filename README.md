# Polynomial-LinkedList-Java
A Java program created for CIS 2353 â€“ Data Structures. This project focuses on handling polynomial expressions using singly linked lists. It reads polynomial strings from a file, stores each as a linked chain of nodes (terms), displays them, and allows the user to add any two together interactively.

Features:
1)Parses polynomials like 4x^2+2x+3 from a text file.
2)Represents each term as a Node (coefficient, exponent).
3)Stores complete polynomials as linked lists.
4)Adds two polynomials and automatically combines like terms.
5)Displays updated polynomial list after each addition.
6)Validates user input and handles basic errors.

Concepts Practiced:
1)Linked Lists (singly-linked)
2)File input handling
3)Object-oriented programming (classes, constructors, static methods)
4)User interaction and input validation
