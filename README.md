# Polynomial-LinkedList-Java
A Java program created for CIS 2353 â€“ Data Structures. This project focuses on handling polynomial expressions using singly linked lists. It reads polynomial strings from a file, stores each as a linked chain of nodes (terms), displays them, and allows the user to add any two together interactively.
